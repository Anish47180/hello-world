# hello-world
Hi everyone! I am new to code. I've been coding since a month in C#.
Console.WriteLine("I can write sentences with ease and can perform calculations");
int a = 800;
int b = 900;
int c = a + b;
Console.WriteLine(c);
double c = 0193.0;
double d = 0;
if(c + d < 1000)
   Console.WriteLine(The answer is smaller than 1000);
else
   Console.WriteLine(Nothing, I was wrong);
Output:
I can write sentences with ease and can perform calculations.
1700
The answer is smaller than 1000
